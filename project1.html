            <div class="card-body text-success">

              <p class="card-text">One of the main roots of the skills mismatch can be traced back to high school, where many learners tend to shy away from pure mathematics when they reach the tenth grade. This avoidance is often driven by the challenges they face in the earlier grades. Even those who choose to pursue pure mathematics encounter difficulties in coping with the subject. The matriculation results of 2023 reflect this struggle, as only 63.5% of learners managed to pass pure mathematics. This trend could potentially lead to a high percentage of learners entering tertiary education to study majors that may have a significant number of unemployed graduates. Consequently, only a few will secure spots in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), education, and health fields. Addressing these challenges at the high school level is crucial for improving outcomes at the tertiary level and aligning education with employment needs.</p>
